MoleEngine is a general-purpose 2D game engine written in Rust and intended as a hobby project for personal use.
Its primary focuses are cool physics tools and a simple interface that allows for quick prototyping.
I write a [blog](https://moletrooper.github.io/blog/) about its development on my personal website.

Current state: ECS is mostly done, beginning work on physics and graphics.
